## Welcome~ 👋!
My name is Hong Phuc but you can call me Pepe

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate Software Developer with a love for web app development. I'm also currently focusing on Data Analysis. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive solutions.

I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at HCM University of Technology and am nearing graduation. My aim is to sharpen my skills in developing programs (currently I'm learning about web development) and to work in Data/AI if I have the chance.
